    "- **Base Case**: When the capacity of the knapsack C = 0, the maximum profit P(0) = 0 because no items can be added to the knapsack.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Recursive Step**: For a knapsack with capacity C > 0, the maximum profit P(C) can be found by considering all items i from 0 to n-1. For each item i, if the item can fit into the knapsack (i.e., w<sub>i</sub> &le; C), we consider either including item i or not. Including item i yields a profit of p<sub>i</sub> plus the maximum profit of a knapsack with reduced capacity C - w<sub>i</sub> (since including the item consumes w<sub>i</sub> units of the capacity). We choose the item i that maximizes this sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive formula captures the essence of dynamic programming by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems (i.e., finding the maximum profit for smaller capacities of the knapsack). However, solving this recursively would be inefficient due to overlapping subproblems and recomputation. This is typically resolved by memoization or converting the recursive formula into an iterative solution using dynamic programming, where results of subproblems are stored and reused."

This way, each smaller subproblem is solved first, and its solution is used to solve larger subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Create an array `knapsack` of size C + 1 to store the maximum profit for capacities 0 to C. Initialize all elements of `knapsack` to 0, since the maximum profit for a knapsack of capacity \\(0\\) is \\(0\\).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Maximum Profit for Each Capacity**: For each item i from 0 to n-1, check if the item can fit into the knapsack of current capacity c (i.e., w<sub>i</sub> &le; c). If it can, calculate the profit of including this item, which is p<sub>i</sub> + knapsack[c - w<sub>i</sub>] (the profit of the item plus the maximum profit for the remaining capacity). Update `knapsack[c]` to the maximum of its current value and this new profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result**: After filling the `dp` array, the maximum profit for the knapsack of capacity \\(C\\) will be stored in `dp[C]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `C`: The total weight capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "- `weights`: An array where `weights[i]` is the weight of the i<sup>th</sup> item.\n",
    "- `profits`: An array where `profits[i]` is the profit of the i<sup>th</sup> item.\n",
